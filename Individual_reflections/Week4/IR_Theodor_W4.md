# Individual reflection: Theodor Khademi, week 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Vart är jag idag?  
Today I have a good understanding on how scrum is implemented in the process of the project. On the graphical level I have started to 
learn how app-development works but I still haven't had any experience on the actual functionality side yet. Hoping to change that by next sprints end.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to be more secure with my skills in app-development when it comes to functionality and overall structure in the coding
so I can help the group and the project go forward as smooth as possible. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit? 
Continue watching tutorials online and take part of the knowldege my group members have. Also just learning by doing, not be afraid to
make mistakes. Making sure to choose a task that involves working with functionality.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have experience on how it is working in a software project and using tools to smooth the development of the app. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue sharing my knowledge wherever it is neccessary in the group. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active and present in all of the group meetings in case anyone has questions. Continue introducing useful tools.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have a good understanding of how scrum is implemented effectivley in the project. This sprint I acted as the product owner which
was interesting because I was forced to think of how to prioritze the project from an entirley different perspective which is very
important for us developers to do. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue galvanizing my group members and myself to continue using Scrum as we have done this week to keep a good momentum 
going in the process of the project. I also want to make sure most group members have a chance to be a product owner for a sprint
as I feel like you get to learn how to prioritize tasks from a different perspective which is important. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active in meetings and having Scrum in the back of my mind at all times to measure up if we are using it effectively. 
Deciding that I am not going to be product owner this week and challenging other members to the task.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
In terms of assignments I have been an active part in writing our team reflection for this week. In terms of app-development and 
finishing tasks I have finished my chosen user story for this sprint on time with all criterias met. It was mostly only doing graphical
things for the app. Which was good for me as it was easy to understand and implement more quicly for someone without any prior experience.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue to be able to work on the functionality part of the development of the app with confidence.
That way I will be able to be a bigger and more versatile asset to the group.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
I will take on a more hefty, functionality-centered user story this week but will make sure that I will work in a pair with someone a bit more experienced so that I can learn
but also to ensure that the task is done with a good quality. I will also keep asking the members for help if neccessary.
