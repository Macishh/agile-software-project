# Individual reflection: Robin Repo Wecklauf, week 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have a basic understanding of what a Scrum master does since I was one this week. I also got
to reflect on our user stories. In terms of app-development, I have a good understanding of the work that has been done so far. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to learn how to be a better Scrum master. I want to get a deeper understanding of user stories in general - how to prioritize 
them correctly after what gives the most value and so forth. I also want to become an expert on the Android-side of our project. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit? 
We can try all try out the Scrum master role and help each other out as much as possible, so that I get more perspectives on how this role can be approched. 
Regarding the user stories, we can gather useful information online and ask our supervisor or our teachers in this course. 
To get a more advanced understanding of the components I can gather information from the internet, ask for help from my group, discuss it or do pair-programming.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I am confident in what state the project is in right now, and what to do next in terms of both agile
development and programming-wise. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to share my knowledge as much as I can in order to achieve a good workflow amongst all and help my group if they need help.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve my goal, I will be active in every group meeting and be open to share my knowledge with anyone, no matter what it might be about.
I will also provide the group with useful information and participate in discussions.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Var är jag idag?  
I have gotten a more advanced understanding of the implementation of Scrum during this course. This week, I got to try out the
Scrum master role.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to maximize the efficiency of the workflow in Scrum.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
In order to achieve this goal, my group and I must try to have the similar vision and try our best to be active in the meetings.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have participated in writing the team reflection for this week. Me and Johan have worked on the map-side of the project this week.
This includes getting a clickable marker of an umbrella stand on the map that shows a popup with some information about that stand.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to contribute with the team's deliveries according to my best possible ability. I also want to help my team members
if they need help with anything.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve this goal, I have to be putting in the hours needed in order to get my user stories done in time and try to offer my help
to my team members.
