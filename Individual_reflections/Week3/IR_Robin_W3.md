# Individual reflection: Robin Repo Wecklauf, week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have a very basic understanding of what a Scrum master does. I also do not know how many user stories we can take upon ourselves 
that actually is finished by the end of the sprint. I have a basic understanding of what user acceptance testing is.
In terms of app-development, I have a basic understanding of the components that is available to us, and what components to use in certain situations.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to learn more about the Scrum master role to know every aspect of how Scrum is implemented. I also want to learn more
about what user acceptance testing is and how it works in practice. Furthermore, I want to be able to estimate how many 
user stories we can handle per week to maximize the work done per week. In addition, I want to get a more advanced 
understanding of the components that Android Studio provides. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit? 
We can try all try out the Scrum master role and help each other out as much as possible. To learn more about user acceptance testing
I have to read more about it and participate in at least one session of it. Regarding the user stories, we can 
analyze the workload after each week to see if we should apply more or less user stories per week. To get a more advanced understanding
of the components I can gather information from the internet, ask for help from my group, discuss it or do pair-programming.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I am confident in what state the project is in right now, and what to do next in terms of both agile
development and programming-wise. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to share my knowledge as much as I can in order to achieve a good workflow amongst all and help my group if they need help.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve my goal, I will be active in every group meeting and be open to share my knowledge with anyone, no matter what it might be about.
I will also provide the group with useful information and participate in discussions.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Var är jag idag?  
I have gotten a more advanced understanding of the implementation of Scrum during this course. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to maximize the efficiency of the workflow in Scrum.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
In order to achieve this goal, my group and I must try to have the similar vision and try our best to be active in the meetings.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have participated in writing the team reflection for this week. I also tried to fix an issue with the app's map, which Johan eventually fixed.
In addition, I assisted Marcus a little when trying to implement a navigation bar that slides open. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to take on more work for next week.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve this goal, we have to make the application open for paralell programming - which we now have done!
