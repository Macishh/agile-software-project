# Individual reflection: Theodor Khademi, week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Vart är jag idag?  
At the moment I have a bit more understanding of how scrum is implemented in the process of the project than I've had in earlier weeks
as we have been starting to use it ourseleves as a group a lot more and I have been reading up on Scrum as well. In terms of actual 
app-development I'm still at a begginer-level. This sprint we have started programming and I hope by the end of the sprint I will have
a bit more experience in the different components of app-development. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to be more secure with my skills in app-development so I can help the group and the project go forward as smooth as possible.

### Hur tar jag mig dit? 
Continue watching tutorials online and take part of the knowldege my group members have. Also just learning by doing, not be afraid to
make mistakes. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have experience on how it is working in a software project and using tools to smooth the development of the app. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue sharing my knowledge wherever it is neccessary in the group. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active and present in all of the group meetings in case anyone has questions. Continue introducing useful tools.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have a better understanding on how Scrum is implemented in a project than previous weeks. As a group we have started to use it in a more 
disciplinary fashion in our meetings and when developing the app which has boosted my knowledge as well. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue galvanizing my group members and myself to continue using Scrum as we have done this week to keep a good momentum 
going in the process of the project. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active in meetings and having Scrum in the back of my mind at all times to measure up if we are using it effectively. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
In terms of assignments I have been an active part in writing our team reflection for this week. In terms of app-development and 
finishing tasks I have had a slower start than some of my group members due to fact that I have had no earlier experience. 

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to be able to work on the development of the app with confidence that I can finish all of my tasks in time and with good quality. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
In the beggining it would be smarter for me to do smaller, simpler tasks so I can continue working hard on learning the basics of app-development and continue learning by doing. 
Keep asking the members for help if neccessary.
