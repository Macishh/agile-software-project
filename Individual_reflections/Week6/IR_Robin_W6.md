# Individual reflection: Robin Repo Wecklauf, week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have a good understanding of how Scrum is implemented efficiently in a project and how the meetings should be structured in order to achieve this. I have also learned more about Firebase as a whole and how it could potentially be implemented in this project. This includes importing/exporting data using Firebase Firestore. 

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to learn more about Firebase and how it should correctly be used in this project.  

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve this goal, I can read more on the documentation about Firebase, watch tutorials online and ask my fellow team members for help if they have more knowledge about this than I do.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have been doing pair-programming and provided the team with useful documentation about how to export data in Firebase. 

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to continue doing pair-programming and help anyone who feels like they need any help at all. I always want to be alert and active if someone wants help, no matter what the problem might be.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?
To achieve this goal, I want to continue being alert, active and have a high involvement whenever someone have questions regarding anything that I feel like I can contribute with a good answer. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have been participated in every meeting this week, which is sprint planning, sprint review, retrospective and standups. 

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to be present in every meeting and try to see that we plan each sprint in an as efficient and good way as possible.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve this goal, I want to continue being present and contribute with the my current knowledge so that each sprint is being planned as efficient as possible. We can also analyse how the meeting went in order to come up with improvements.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have been a part of writing the team reflection together with my group. I have also done some research about Firebase with Johan and provided the team with useful documentation and potential solutions to existing problem. I have been a part of pull requests, which ensures that the quality of someone else's written code is good. 

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to continue the development with the group, which entails completing my user stories. I also want to help my team if they need help with anything in their user stories.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Do my user stories in time so I can have time over to help my team, if needed.
