# Individual reflection: Theodor Khademi, week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have a good understanding on how scrum is implemented and structured in meetings as we have as a group focused on having scrum masters that can 
lead the meeting forward in a efficent way. In terms of app-development I have continued to work on connecting functionality with the graphical
aspects of the application. I also conducted more tests on the things I have worked on. This sprint I have togethet with Eric worked on being able to finish the process of being able to rent an umbrella.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to learn how we are to going to be connecting our rental history into a Firebase database. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit? 
Our group has sent out tutorials where we can watch how Firebase is implemented into an apoplication. I will also take help from my 
groupmembers whi have had earlier experience with Firebase. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have worked together with my partner in my pair-programming who doesn't have as much experience in software development as I. I have been 
able to help him with eventual problems or questions that came up during the sprint.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue sharing my knowledge wherever it is neccessary in the group through continued through pair-programming and meetings. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active and present in all of the group meetings to have full understanding of the application 
we are creating so I can be ready to answer eventual questions. Continue introducing useful tools that can be used to ease the development process.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Vart är jag idag?  
This sprint I have again acted as product owner on the sprint meeting at the beggining of the sprint. Ensuring that we have chosen
user stories for the sprint that give the most value to both the user and our stakeholders. I will be the acting product owner for all sprints as we 
don't have much time left.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue galvanizing my group members and myself to continue using Scrum as we have done this week to keep a good momentum 
going in the process of the project. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active in meetings and having Scrum in the back of my mind at all times to measure up if we are using it effectively. 
Try to see things we can improve on from last weeks sprint and adress those during our sprint planning meeting

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
In terms of assignments I have been an active part in writing our team reflection for this week. In terms of app-development and 
finishing tasks I and my pair programming partner Eric have finished our chosen user story for this sprint on time with all criterias met.
We have focosed on being to be able to finish the rental process by creating different windows for when the rental is active, done etc. and crating methods 
to support these functions. This task was most optimal for us as we felt like it naturally progressed from our previous task last sprint. 

### Vart ska jag?  
From here on out I feel like I have a good understanding of the different parts of android development. I want to therefore 
cointinue working diligently with team, finding the most optimal user stories for me and eventual partner/s to finish during the 
next sprint. I want to also now be a bigger part in helping the team with eventual problems during the development process, so we 
all can finish our user stories on time. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Make sure to plan my sprint from the user story/ies I have decided on taking on in the beggining of the week to create an optimal 
development plan. Have an open communication with the rest of the group to ask for help or offer help wherever neccessary.
