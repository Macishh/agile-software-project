# Individual reflection: Theodor Khademi, week 7

As this is my last individual reflection for the project, my focus for this reflection will mainly lie in reflecting on what I have 
learned on the project and the course throughout the weeks, not what I have to learn further and how I get there. My primary goal now is to keep the knowledge
I already have and being able to apply that to future projects.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Vart är jag idag?  
Before the project started I had a good understanding and competence in object-oriented programming. I also had earlier experience on working
in a software project. This knowledge made it easier for me in the beggining to envision how our application was going to be structured and how
we were going to divide the work between us remotely using Git and workflow tools like Trello. However I had no prior knowledge in Android development
or Scrum, which made it hard to implement my ideas into the project. 
 
By completing tasks that were easier at the beginning of the project and then slowly increasing 
the tasks complexity with each sprint, for example starting with graphical development first and moving on to more logic/functionality development later on, 
made it so I could learn Android development at a comfortable pace and today I feel like I have a much bettter grasp of how it all works. 

In terms of Scrum, by being active in every meeting and learning through being present at lectures and doing my own research, I feel like 
I have a good understanding on why it's such a helpful tool when working on an agile project. The implementation of Scrum masters and acting 
product owners a couple of sprints into the project helped with the understanding immensely as well as it gave a lot more structure and 
proffesionalism into the meetings. 


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Vart är jag idag?  
Due to having previous experience in doing a software project, I could help the team throughout the project by sharing many helpful tools when 
developing software like Trello, how to do pull requests as well as any relevant coding tips. I could even at the end of the project help with some 
Android specific questions as well especially when I was doing pair-programming. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have been an active member in almost every Sprint meeting we have had which has led to me having a great understanding on how to implement it into 
future projects. I encouraged my group to keep using Scrum in the way that we did each sprint to keep a good momentum going in the process of the project. 
Some weeks into the project it was also decided that I was going to be the acting product owner for the sprint planning meeting.
This forced me to think of how to prioritze the project from an entirley different perspective and led to better user story prioritization for us and our stakeholders. 
I wanted to rotate the product owner position within the group so some of the other members could try it on as well but they decided that changing 
the person would force them to learn how to act as product owner which would take time away from development, which I agreed with, so I stayed as product 
owner for the remainder of the project. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
Throughout the project my goal was always to have my tasks marked as Done at the end of every sprint which I have achieved every sprint including this one. 
At the start of the project I mainly focused on graphical, front-end development by creating a page for the "Help"-segment of our app. 
But as the project went on I started doing more functionality based developing mainly for the user to make and complete rentals, an important task 
as it invlolved almost the entireity of our MVP. I did this mainly by pair-programming with Eric which helped as we could bounce ideas and knowledge across eachother which led to quick development time. 

In terms of assigments I contributed to the teams social contract and almost every team reflection.
