# Individual reflection: Robin Repo Wecklauf, week 7
My focus for this individual reflection will be on what I have learned throughout the course and not what my goal is or how to achieve the goal. I will do this because this is my last reflection for this fun course, unfortunately.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Var är jag idag?  
I had experience in completing a project in Android development already with the use of Scrum in a previous course and from during a short period in a Summer job. I also had a good understanding of object-oriented programming. This helped me a lot during this course because I recognized all the tools that we have used, i.e Trello, Git and Java. 

Because I had this experience I always tried to help my team with any of their problem in the beginning. This ensured that everyone got off to a good start, and became more time efficient in the long run. 

I now understand why Scrum is such a useful tool when working in a project, of any scale. I have learned a lot about the tool throughout the course by being active in every lecture given, every meeting we have had and of my own research about the subject. I feel like the use of Scrum masters and product owners gave the project a boost in our group, both in efficiency and structure-wise. That had a great impact on us as a group, and I feel like we all evolved very much every week.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Var är jag idag?  
Since I had a great experience already, I always tried to be active in our meetings and offer my help to everyone who feel like they needed a hand. I also provided the group with useful material regarding any future implementation or any question that I postponed to answer. I have also been doing pair-programming during the project, and it has been great for both of us since we see a problem from different angles. In the beginning of the project, I also held in a Git workshop that was very appreciated.
