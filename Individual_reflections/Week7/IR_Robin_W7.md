# Individual reflection: Robin Repo Wecklauf, week 7
My focus for this individual reflection will be on what I have learned throughout the course and not what my goal is or how to achieve the goal. I will do this because this is my last reflection for this fun course, unfortunately.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Var är jag idag?  
I had experience in completing a project in Android development already with the use of Scrum in a previous course and from during a short period in a Summer job. I also had a good understanding of object-oriented programming. This helped me a lot during this course because I recognized all the tools that we have used, i.e Trello, Git and Java. 

Because I had this experience I always tried to help my team with any of their problem in the beginning. This ensured that everyone got off to a good start, and became more time efficient in the long run. 

I now understand why Scrum is such a useful tool when working in a project, of any scale. I have learned a lot about the tool throughout the course by being active in every lecture given, every meeting we have had and of my own research about the subject. I feel like the use of Scrum masters and product owners gave the project a boost in our group, both in efficiency and structure-wise. That had a great impact on us as a group, and I feel like we all evolved very much every week.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Var är jag idag?  
Since I had a great experience already, I always tried to be active in our meetings and offer my help to everyone who feel like they needed a hand. I also provided the group with useful material regarding any future implementation or any question that I postponed to answer. I have also been doing pair-programming during the project, and it has been great for both of us since we see a problem from different angles. In the beginning of the project, I also held in a Git workshop that was very appreciated. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Var är jag idag?  
I always tried to stay focused and active during the meetings we have had in order to make it as efficient as possible. I was also the first one who tried out the scrum master role, with no experience what so ever. This led to the meetings being more structured, which we all liked. Therefore, we decided to switch the role so that everyone who wanted to try it out got to do it.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
In the beginning, I was a part of choosing this particular project together with my team. Later on, I held a Git workshop to introduce this tool for some and refresh the memory of the version control system that we used. I have worked a lot with the Google Maps API. This includes adding an clickable umbrella marker on the map that shows a popup with some basic information about that particular stand. This is the view that enables the user to actually rent an umbrella. I also worked a lot with adding a route from the user's specific location to a stand, which was very fun to implement! All this includes doing front-end work like designing the GUI for a specific view. In addition, I have participated in writing the social contract and every team reflection. I have also been a part of creating both a domain model and an updated UML over the model with my team. I have also been a part of some pull requests about the implementation of the database, which was super rewarding because my knowledge in Firebase is not that high.
