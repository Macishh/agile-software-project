# Individual reflection: Robin Repo Wecklauf, week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have gotten a better understanding of what user stories to prioritise in terms of value for our product owners. I learned this through a meeting with them when discussing the functionality. In terms of app-development, I have learned more about the Google Maps API when trying to figure out how to get routes to a specific stand. I have also learned how to pass information through different fragments. I noticed that I have a very basic understanding of the design-part of the application (XML). Firebase is something I want to learn more about.

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to have meetings with our stakeholders to ensure that the user stories are good enough. I also want to write better acceptance criteria to help the development move forward smoothly. Another goal is to be more secure on Google Maps API to not spend so much time on debugging. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve this goal, I want to be an active part of the meetings with our stakeholders. To write better acceptance criteria, we can be very thorough with every user story and discuss it deeply. To be more secure on the Google Maps API, I can read more on the documentation and watch tutorials online or ask my group for help I am insecure about anything.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have good knowledge within the Google Maps API that enables me to be able to help my team members. I am also a good understanding of the structure of the app.

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to continue doing pair-programming and help anyone who feels like they need any help at all. I always want to be alert and active if someone wants help, no matter what the problem might be.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?
To achieve this goal, I want to continue being alert, active and have a high involvement whenever someone have questions regarding anything that I feel like I can contribute with a good answer. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Var är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have been participated in every meeting this week, which is sprint planning, sprint review, retrospective and standups. 

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to be present in every meeting and try to see that we plan each sprint in an as efficient and good way as possible.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
To achieve this goal, I want to continue being present and contribute with the my current knowledge so that each sprint is being planned as efficient as possible. We can also analyse how the meeting went in order to come up with improvements.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
At the moment, I have been a part of writing the team reflection together with my group. I also worked with Johan on with our user story to achieve a route from the user's current location to a specific stand. We managed to get it done by passing information between fragments and using another API. I also participated in helping the rest of the group designing an updated UML-diagram over our current model.

### Vart ska jag?  
The goal is to continue the development with the group, which entails completing my user stories. I also want to help my team if they need help with anything in their user stories.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Do my user stories in time so I can have time over to help my team, if needed.
