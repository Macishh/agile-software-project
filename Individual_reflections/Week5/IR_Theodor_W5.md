# Individual reflection: Theodor Khademi, week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have a good understanding on how scrum is implemented and structured in meetings as we have as a group focused on having scrum masters that can 
lead the meeting forward in a efficent way. This sprint we also had a much more on-hands meeting with our stakeholders which has led to a much greater understanding
in evaluating what user stories give more value. In terms of app-development I have learned connecting functionality with the graphical
aspects of the application. I have also expanded my knowledge of different useful components of app-development such as implementing 
chronometers.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to be more secure in my ability to write tests on the methods I code ensuring that the application has the best quality it can have 
and make it much easier to find and understand bugs on the app. Right now my debugging is taking up valuable time progressing the app.

### Hur tar jag mig dit? 
I am going to look at previous projects where I have written tests before and be sure to take help from my group members if neccessary.
I also need to begin writing tests in tandem when writing my methods as it saves time and it will be easier to understand in the moment instead of 
leaving it for later when you might have re-learn what you have written.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### Vart är jag idag?  
I have worked together with my partner in my pair-programming who doesn't have as much experience in software development as I. I have been 
able to help him with eventual problems or questions that came up during the sprint.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue sharing my knowledge wherever it is neccessary in the group. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active and present in all of the group meetings in case anyone has questions to have full understanding of the application 
we are creating. Continue introducing useful tools that can be used to ease the development process.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### Vart är jag idag?  
This sprint I have again acted as product owner on the sprint meeting at the beggining of the sprint. Ensuring that we have chosen
user stories for the sprint that give the most value to both the user and our stakeholders.

### Vart ska jag?  
I want to continue galvanizing my group members and myself to continue using Scrum as we have done this week to keep a good momentum 
going in the process of the project. Last week I wrote that I also wanted to make sure most group members have a chance to be a product owner for a sprint
as I felt like you get to learn how to prioritize tasks from a different perspective which is important. This sprint this couldn't as 
we were short on time during the meeting to decide but I am hoping that someone else is willing to change that this next sprint.

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Continue being active in meetings and having Scrum in the back of my mind at all times to measure up if we are using it effectively. 
Try to see things we can improve on from last weeks sprint and adress those during our sprint planning meeting.
Deciding that I am not going to be product owner this week and challenging other members to the task.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

### Vart är jag idag?  
In terms of assignments I have been an active part in writing our team reflection for this week. In terms of app-development and 
finishing tasks I and my pair programming partner Eric have finished our chosen user story for this sprint on time with all criterias met.
We have focused on finishing all functionality when it comes to renting an umbrella and beeing able to see how much time has gone and how much 
your rental costed. 

### Vart ska jag?  
From here on out I feel like I have a good understanding of the different parts of android development. I want to therefore 
cointinue working diligently with team, finding the most optimal user stories for me and eventual partner/s to finish during the 
next sprint. I want to also now be a bigger part in helping the team with eventual problems during the development process, so we 
all can finish our user stories on time. 

### Hur tar jag mig dit?  
Make sure to plan my sprint from the user story/ies I have decided on taking on in the beggining of the week to create an optimal 
development plan. Have an open communication with the rest of the group to ask for help or offer help wherever neccessary.
