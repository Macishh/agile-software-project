# Umberent

## Introduction

The weather can vary greatly based on where you are, or depending on the season. 
Some days, for example, can turn from radiant sun to rain in a couple of hours, especially in Gothenburg. 
It's cumbersome to carry around on an umbrella in case it rains.

Umberent solves this by adding umbrella stands throughout the city which allows a user to rent and return an umbrella through the application.
